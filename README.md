# Advent_of_Code_2022
My Adventure with Advent of Code 2022 (https://adventofcode.com/2022).

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like."

My first ever attempt with this annual puzzle project is being solved with Python.
